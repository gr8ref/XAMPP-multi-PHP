# XAMPP-multi-PHP
Xampp server multi php versions on Windows

In C:\xampp\ add two versions of php, in my case php7 and php5. Just download php versions from windows.php.net<br>
Also, get two folders apache7 and apache5, and phpmyadmin5 and phpmyadmin7, downloaded from XAMPP download page, to make sure .bat files can run correctly.<br><br>

Make sure you install apache and mysql as a service<br>
Run as administrator set-php-5.bat or set-php-7.bat
